Once you are logged in at the central level, you can seamlessly move from one Hub to another. Each Hub is a separate environment where conversations happen locally. In fact, in each Hub you get your own name (technically: pseudonym). You can change this name yourself, per Hub.  Your personal data for central login (email address and mobile phone number) are not shared with Hubs.",
